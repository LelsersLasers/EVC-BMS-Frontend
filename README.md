SvelteKit webapp for the BMS for Purdue's Electric Vehicle Club's high voltage battery.

## TODO:

- Loading back to T/F instead of a count?
	- Or 2 separate loading states? (one for data loop one for parameters)
- Change the ip address even if currently connected
- Section dividers
- Double vs single quotes
- Bar of the current (amps)
- More readable bars
	- Make the unit (V, A, C, etc) and label (1, FET, avg, etc) smaller/italtics/ligher font/something
- Improve look of "waiting for ip" and loading displays
- In general, better CSS
- Component for the collections of bars (instead of repeating the same code)
- Parameters
	- Buttons?
	- Log download
	- Bypass
	- Confirm on shutdown (forceDischargeEnable,Â forceDischargeDisable)
- File upload
- Fix graphing
- WEBSOCKETS?????
