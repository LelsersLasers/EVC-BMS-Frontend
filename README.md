# EVC BMS Frontend

SvelteKit webapp for the BMS for Purdue's Electric Vehicle Club's high voltage battery.

## TODO:

- File upload
- Auto graph from `log.csv`
- Appearance:
	- In general, better CSS
	- Ex: better color diversity
	- Maybe make the whole thing dark mode
- Svelte component for the collections of bars (instead of repeating the same code)?
- CSS for mobile
