# EVC BMS Frontend

SvelteKit webapp for the BMS for Purdue's Electric Vehicle Club's high voltage battery.

## TODO:

- File upload modal
- Svelte component for the collections of bars and bars (instead of repeating the same code)?
- Parameters/GUI inputs for all hardcoded values
	- Temp
	- Voltage difference
	- Current
- Automatically create a graph from `log.csv`
- Appearance:
	- In general, better CSS
	- Ex: better color diversity (and maybe some less aggressive colors)
	- Update mobile CSS
